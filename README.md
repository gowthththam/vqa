## ðŸ“Š Features

### Voice Analysis
The dashboard captures and displays three key voice metrics in real-time:
- **Pitch**: Frequency analysis of the agent's voice

- Color-coded timeline (positive, negative, neutral, silence)
- Overall sentiment score
- Context-aware emotion detection

### Knowledge Integration
Contextually relevant knowledge base articles are presented based on conversation:
- Quick access to solutions
- Categorized information
- Copy functionality for sharing with customers

## ðŸ”„ Data Flow

1. Audio is captured via microphone and analyzed by the Python backend
2. Voice metrics are calculated and sent to the frontend via WebSocket
3. React components visualize the data in real-time
4. Agent can view insights and take appropriate actions

## ðŸ“± Responsive Design
The dashboard is designed to work across different screen sizes, with a responsive grid layout that adapts to the available space.
